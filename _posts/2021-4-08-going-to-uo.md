I am thrilled to announce that I will be remaining at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/) to gain my PhD in Molecular Biology through the [Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB)](http://molbio.uoregon.edu/)! Because my first year in the program will consist of rotations in three different labs (as well as taking classes and working as a teaching assistant), I do not know exactly which lab I will be joining or the exact topic that I will be studying. However, I do know that I want to continue my work into the intricate relationship between the microbiome and human health.
