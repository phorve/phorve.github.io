I was invited to be a guest on the [American Society for Microbiology's](asm.org) [Editors in Conversation](https://asm.org/Podcasts/Editors-in-Conversation) podcast! Editors in Conversation is the official podcast of the American Society for Microbiology Journals. Editors in Conversation features discussions between ASM Journals Editors, researchers and clinicians working on the most cutting edge issues in the microbial sciences. In the episode, entitled "*Pandemic Built Environment*", we discussed our previous paper on SARS-CoV-2 and the built environment and how people can best manage the indoor environment.
