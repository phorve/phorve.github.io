Through a collaboration between the Biology and the Built Environment Center, Institute for Health in the Built Environment, and Oregon Health & Science University , we surveyed the viable microbial communities that were present throughout a ward in Kohler Pavilion at OHSU in Portland, Oregon. Previous work from our lab group demonstrated that light exposure modulates microbial survival and community composition. We sought to explore this same relationship in the real-world scenario of the hospital.

While no trends were found in relation to sunlight differentials in the patient rooms, apparent trends in microbial abundance were observed. We hypothesize that these trends are due in part to the movement of healthcare staff throughout the hospital and specifically in more central areas of the ward. Check out the full paper here!
