At the University of Oregon (and many other graduate schools throughout the country), the first year of your PhD is dedicated to spending a couple of month in a single lab to get acquainted with the school, different styles and topics of research, and learn what you will want to eventually focus on when you begin to pursue your dissertation. In my case, I will rotate through three different labs and then decide on a final lab hopefully sometime in June 2022. For my first rotation, I joined the Parthasarathy lab!

The Parthasarathy lab, as described on their website, are...
>"biophysicists exploring the structure and dynamics of biological materials such as cellular membranes, the gut microbiome, and the organs of developing animals. Weâ€™re also interested in general questions of how soft materials and complex fluids self-organize. We explore these issues using a variety of techniques, with special emphasis on optical microscopy and computational image analysis"

Check out some of the awesome videos that the lab has taken in the past!
