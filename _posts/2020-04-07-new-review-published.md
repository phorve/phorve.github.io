Since announcing the release of our preprint on COVID-19and the built environment, our lab group has been fielding questions, comments and concerns around our initial manuscript. During this time, we also submitted our manuscript to [mSystems](https://msystems.asm.org/).

Based on the comments that we received from reviewers, we expanded upon our discussions of the use of humidity and light (full spectrum and ultraviolet) as potential tools for the mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. We also developed a new section on special considerations for healthcare settings. It was really great to receive so much feedback on this work before sending it for publication, and I really think it improved the final product. The discuss around relative humidity and the impact that it may have on viruses was one of the more disputed topics that we discuss, so we wanted to begin to compile all of the current literature concerning viruses and relative humidity. Myself and the other authors would love input from other researchers if we have missed anything. We've created a google sheets to hopefully begin a larger conversation around this topic.
