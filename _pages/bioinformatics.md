intro:
  - excerpt: 'I was thrust into the world of bioinformatics when I definitely thought that I was just going to be working with bacteria in petri dishes... and that's okay! As an undergrad, I ran my assays, got my data, and then had no idea what to do with it! I went to my advisor because I had downloaded R but had no idea how to run a command! "It tells me to hit enter, but every time I do that, nothing happens and it just adds another paragraph!" I'm pretty sure my advisor's eyes rolled aaaaalllll the way to the back of her head.<b>And even though my advisor was more than welcome to sit down with me and try to explain every single thing, advisors have so much more on their plate. So I took my bioinformatics training into my own hands. I starting reading papers, finding online tutorials, reading articles and depositories on [GitHub](https://github.com), and mindlessly scrolling through my advisor's code, trying to figure out what all of these random letters, symbols, and numbers meant.<b>Despite my extremely rough start, I have learned to really like bioinformatics and all of the wonders that come with it! It is always so exciting to me to have a fresh set of data to look at and see what you can learn from it! And I want to try to make that inevitable transition from confident biologist to struggling bioinformatician just a little bit easier for anyone else out there that wants the help, so I've compiled lessons, code, and tutorials that can hopefully help you get started on your bioinformatics journey!"'
