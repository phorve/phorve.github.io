After five rounds of peer review, 4 reviewers, and nearly a year of revisions, it is now officially published! Check out the final version of the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12898&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IndoorAir.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of May and June 2020, we sampled multiple of the AHUs at OHSU hospital. I’m gonna do my best as a biologist to describe the HVAC setup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GIANT air handling penthouse at the hospital is made up of 10 individual AHUs, each of which are more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/E5N8JXUVEAc1TUa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air from the hospital returns, mixes with some portion of fresh outside air, is filtered through the pre-filters (MERV10), undergoes a second, more extensive filter (MERV15) at the final filters and then returns back to the hospital through the supply air dampers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/E5N7H2JUcAwiUri.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took three samples at each of these three points (pre-filter, final filter, supply air damper) each time we were able to access the AHU. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using qRT-PCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/E5N7kjBVIAE7rbm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/E5N8MkQVkAItkNd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we were able to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We saw the highest abundance at the pre-filters and the second highest at the supply air dampers (!!). Yes, we saw significant abundance AFTER the MERV15 filters! Here are some important caveats to that data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We did not look at the potential viability of these samples, though it is unlikely, especially after filtering, that there were viable viral particles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have no evidence that these positives came from full genomes but could have instead been from genome fragments, again low likelihood of infectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the point that we sampled, the filters had not recently been changed and the hospital had been admitting a large number of COVID+ individuals for months.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the other side of the coin, we suspect that swabbing these air filters is not the best way to do this sampling. Destructive sampling of the filters would have likely yielded higher abundances but was not possible for this study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, maybe filters aren’t perfect but we already knew this! No mitigation strategy is going to be 100%! The importance of these mitigation strategies is to layer them. So what can we do to layer on top of filters, especially outside of healthcare settings with MERV15 filters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear a mask! (Obvious caveats  here)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase ventilation and introduction of fresh air&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining relative humidity between 40-60%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a HEPA air purifier in your home, office, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For your home AC/HVAC unit, use the highest rated filter your system can handle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more, we are moving into a new stage of the pandemic where detection in large areas is becoming more important. One of these such tools could be sampling of centralized HVAC systems in large buildings as individuals return back to work&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Evidence continues to grow supporting the aerosol transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from ten different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high-efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transfer of virions to locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present necessary guidance for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration. Furthermore, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in HVAC components indicates the potential utility as an indoor environmental surveillance location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a collaboration between the Biology and the Built Environment Center, Institute for Health in the Built Environment, and Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University , we surveyed the viable microbial communities that were present throughout a ward in Kohler Pavilion at OHSU in Portland, Oregon. Previous work from our lab group demonstrated that light exposure modulates microbial survival and community composition. We sought to explore this same relationship in the real-world scenario of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no trends were found in relation to sunlight differentials in the patient rooms, apparent trends in microbial abundance were observed. We hypothesize that these trends are due in part to the movement of healthcare staff throughout the hospital and specifically in more central areas of the ward.

&lt;p&gt;In light of the developing worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we sought to better understand the potential for aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 to enter into HVAC systems and potentially persist. Check out the preprint &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20141085v1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the abstract below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Available information on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission by small particle aerosols continues to evolve rapidly. To assess the potential role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were being treated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers. While samples were not evaluated for viral infectivity, the presence of viral RNA in air handlers raises the possibility that viral particles can enter and travel within the air handling system of a hospital, from room return air through high efficiency MERV-15 filters and into supply air ducts. Although no known transmission events were determined to be associated with these specimens, the findings suggest the potential for HVAC systems to facilitate transmission by environmental contamination via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected persons reside. More work is needed to further evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems and to verify effectiveness of building operations mitigation strategies for the protection of building occupants. These results are important within and outside of healthcare settings and may present a matter of some urgency for building operators of facilities that are not equipped with high-efficiency filtration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since announcing the release of our preprint on COVID-19and the built environment, our lab group has been fielding questions, comments and concerns around our initial manuscript. During this time, we also submitted our manuscript to &lt;a href=&quot;https://msystems.asm.org/&quot;&gt;mSystems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the comments that we received from reviewers, we expanded upon our discussions of the use of humidity and light (full spectrum and ultraviolet) as potential tools for the mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. We also developed a new section on special considerations for healthcare settings. It was really great to receive so much feedback on this work before sending it for publication, and I really think it improved the final product. The discuss around relative humidity and the impact that it may have on viruses was one of the more disputed topics that we discuss, so we wanted to begin to compile all of the current literature concerning viruses and relative humidity. Myself and the other authors would love input from other researchers if we have missed anything. We’ve created a google sheets to hopefully begin a larger conversation around this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, the virus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected over 125,000 individuals, and been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020&quot;&gt;declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of weeks, my lab has tried to figure out how we could contribute our unique knowledge on the interface between microorganisms and the built environment, or the collection of structures and facilities that we spend the majority of our time. However, we did not in any way want to contribute to the spread of fear and panic surrounding the virus but instead, we wanted to contribute new and useful information that help people feel more prepared for the virus that will likely affect every individual on this earth in one way or another. After putting our heads together, we decided that the way that we could make the biggest impact was to apply what we have learned through years of research in controlling the spread and quantity of microorganisms indoors to SARS-CoV-2. To this point, we have written a paper entitled &lt;em&gt;“2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak: A Review of the Current Literature and Built Environment (BE) Considerations to Reduce Transmission”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper does critically look at and demonstrate some potential flaws in the current infrastructure that is present at many buildings and facilities throughout the world, we also provide potential solutions that can help to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We hope that this review can serve as guidance to all individuals who use and manipulate the built environment around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-print manuscript can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0197/v3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the abstract can be read below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With the increasing spread of severe acute respiratory With the increasing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal, state, county and city governments, universities, school districts, health care facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares, homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission through built environment (BE) mediated pathways. Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information will be useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about whether to implement social- distancing measures and for what duration.&lt;/p&gt;
